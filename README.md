## About Me
Hey there! I'm **Mohammad Ashouri**, a passionate Front-End developer with a keen interest in learning and mastering the art of web development. Currently based Remote.
    
I started my journey in the vast world of programming with a focus on Front-End development. My fascination with crafting beautiful and interactive user experiences drove me to delve deeper into technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I've honed my skills and expanded my toolkit, particularly in frameworks like React and Next.js.
